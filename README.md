# Holberton School - Higher Level Programming

This repository contains various projects and exercises completed as part of the higher-level programming curriculum at Holberton School. The projects focus on learning and applying concepts of Python, C, and other programming languages. It covers everything from basic syntax to more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms.

## Projects

### Python - Hello, World
Basic introduction to Python, covering printing, string manipulation, and basic script creation.
- [Link to directory](./python-hello_world)

### Python - If/Else, Loops, Functions
This project focuses on control flow in Python, such as conditional statements, loops, and defining functions.
- [Link to directory](./python-if_else_loops_functions)

### Python - Import & Modules
This project covers Pythonâ€™s import system, how to use modules, and command-line arguments.
- [Link to directory](./python-import_modules)

### Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
This project introduces Python data structures like lists and tuples, covering basic manipulation techniques.
- [Link to directory](./python-data_structures)

### Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
This project covers more complex data structures, including sets and dictionaries, along with their various operations.
- [Link to directory](./python-more_data_structures)

### Python - Exceptions
This project focuses on error handling using Python exceptions, including the use of `try`, `except`, `finally`, and raising custom exceptions.
- [Link to directory](./python-exceptions)

### Python - Test-Driven Development
This project introduces Test-Driven Development (TDD), using the `unittest` module in Python to ensure code quality.
- [Link to directory](./python-test_driven_development)

## Usage

To run any of the Python scripts:

```bash
$ python3 <filename>.py
```
