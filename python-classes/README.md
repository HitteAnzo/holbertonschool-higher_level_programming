# Python - Classes and Objects

This repository contains Python projects focusing on object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, specifically classes and objects. Each project explores different aspects of OOP, such as encapsulation, instantiation, and method creation, using a `Square` class as the primary example.

| Filename       | Description                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0-square.py`  | Defines an empty class `Square`.                                                                   |
| `1-square.py`  | Defines a class `Square` with a private instance attribute `size`.                                  |
| `2-square.py`  | Defines a class `Square` with input validation for `size` to ensure it is an integer and greater than or equal to 0. |
| `3-square.py`  | Adds a public instance method `area()` that returns the current square area.                        |
| `4-square.py`  | Adds property methods to get and set the private `size` attribute with proper validation.           |
| `5-square.py`  | Adds a method `my_print()` that prints the square with the `#` character or an empty line if `size` is 0. |
| `6-square.py`  | Adds a private instance attribute `position` and updates `my_print()` to print the square at a given position using spaces. |

## Usage

To run the Python scripts, use:

```bash
$ python3 <filename>.py
```

Each file represents a different stage in building and improving the functionality of a Square class in Python.
